[SaltyNote](https://saltynote.com/) is a Chrome Extension that provides the immersive page notes taken experience. 

You can find it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/saltynote/baanghljiehhpljdbonfknboakpfajnn).

### The reason I created this Chrome Extension
It is a short story when I started my new career in the big company, I had to read a lot of internal documentations for ramping up. 
1. Since there are too many links to read, I easily forgot what I had read before.
2. The company has security and privacy concerns, and does not allow using third party note taking applications.

So, I leveraged the internal infrastructure for data storage and built the prototype of this Chrome Extension for note taking.
